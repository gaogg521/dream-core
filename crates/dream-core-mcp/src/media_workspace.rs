//! Telling the built-in media MCP which directory a session works in.
//!
//! The media MCP writes generated images and videos into a directory it is
//! given. It cannot work that directory out for itself: its child process
//! inherits aioncore's cwd rather than the session's (stdio MCP servers are
//! spawned without `current_dir`), and the tool call carries no conversation
//! identity, so there is nothing in the request to resolve either. Left alone
//! it falls back to the application data folder.
//!
//! The misplacement costs more than a wrong path. A conversation renders media
//! result cards by matching a job's workspace against its own, so a job written
//! somewhere else silently loses its thumbnail, its open-folder and regenerate
//! actions, and its cost line — the agent reports a bare path and the user sees
//! nothing. One environment variable restores all of it.
//!
//! Scoped deliberately to this one server. Handing every session MCP server the
//! workspace path would tell arbitrary user-configured processes where the
//! user's files live, which is a much larger decision than "the media tool
//! should save next to the conversation".
