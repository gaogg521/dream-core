//! Local content inspection (T4): the member-side half of company DLP.
//!
//! # Why the check runs here and not on the server
//!
//! The text to inspect is the prompt, and the prompt is assembled on the
//! member's own co-located backend. Inspecting it server-side would mean either
//! a round trip on every single send — latency on the hottest path in the
//! product, and a policy that fails open the moment the company server is
//! unreachable — or inspecting only traffic that happens to go through the
//! company model proxy, which misses the case worth catching most: an employee
//! pasting a contract into a model they configured themselves.
//!
//! So rules come *down* and findings go *up*, and the decision is made locally.
//!
//! # How rules get here
//!
//! Exactly the way managed model channels do (`managed_provider.rs`): the
//! renderer holds the enterprise session, fetches from whichever backend is
//! authoritative for governance, and pushes the result into this local backend.
//! One mechanism covers standalone, server-host and client deployments, because
//! the renderer's governance routing already knows which is which.
//!
//! # What this deliberately is not
//!
//! Not a defence against a member who controls their own machine. Someone
//! determined can stop the sync, patch the binary, or open a browser. This
//! catches the accident — the paste that nobody meant as exfiltration — and
//! gives the company a record of it. Treating it as a hard security boundary
//! would be claiming a guarantee the architecture cannot make.
