//! Realtime collaboration seam (P2-2 reserved framework).
//!
//! No collaboration backend (presence relay / CRDT sync) is wired in here.
//! This is the "reserved adapter" pattern: a config store (see
//! `PlatformService::{get,set}_collaboration_config`) plus a pluggable
//! `CollaborationProvider` trait. `NoopCollaborationProvider` is the default
//! and reports "not configured"; a real provider can be dropped in at the app
//! layer via `PlatformService::with_collaboration_provider`.
//!
//! Distinct from `dream-realtime` (the WebSocket *transport*): this layer is
//! the admin-configured collaboration *backend* (which relay, presence on/off,
//! auth token) — the transport is a separate concern that a real provider would
//! build on.
