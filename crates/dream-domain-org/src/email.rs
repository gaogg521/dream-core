//! Invite-email sending seam (P2-4 onboarding).
//!
//! No SMTP client library is wired in here — this is the "reserved adapter"
//! pattern used elsewhere in the app (e.g. `dream_domain_billing::BillingProvider` for
//! payment): a config store (see `OrgService::{get,set}_smtp_config`) plus a
//! pluggable `EmailSender` trait. `StubEmailSender` is the default and reports
//! "not configured"; when an operator has real SMTP credentials, a real
//! implementation (e.g. wrapping the `lettre` crate) can be dropped in at the
//! app layer without touching this crate.
