//! Integration connector seam (P2-1 reserved framework).
//!
//! No connector client (Octocrab / gitlab / jira / Feishu SDK) is wired in
//! here — this is the same "reserved adapter" pattern used for invite email
//! (`EmailSender`) and billing (`dream_domain_billing::BillingProvider`): a config store
//! (see `OrgService::{list,get,set}_integration`) plus a pluggable
//! `IntegrationProvider` trait. `StubIntegrationProvider` is the default and
//! reports "not configured"; when real credentials and a real client are
//! available, a concrete implementation can be dropped in at the app layer via
//! `OrgService::with_integration_provider` without touching this crate.
