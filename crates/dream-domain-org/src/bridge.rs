//! Cross-tier bridge to the company (真实企业 / one-enterprise) domain.
//!
//! one-org and one-enterprise are same-layer domain crates and must not depend
//! on each other (workspace `AGENTS.md` § Crate Hierarchy). This trait lets a
//! company administrator act on the project groups their company owns; the app
//! layer implements it over `dream_domain_enterprise::EnterpriseService`. When no bridge
//! is wired (personal edition / unit tests), company-scoped tenant management is
//! simply unavailable and the standalone invite-code paths are unaffected.
