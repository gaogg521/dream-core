//! Revoking the credentials that deliberately outlive a session.
//!
//! Removing someone from a company rotates their JWT secret, which kills every
//! session they hold. That is enough for anything gated by a session — but not
//! for a company **model channel token**, whose whole point is to survive JWT
//! rotation (membership changes rotate the secret routinely, and a provisioned
//! channel must not break every time someone joins a project group).
//!
//! So the one credential that outlives the session has to be revoked
//! explicitly, at the same moment and by the same code path. Doing it here
//! rather than leaving it to a UI offboarding flow is deliberate: a leaver
//! keeping a working key to the company's models is precisely the failure the
//! channel design exists to prevent, and a step a caller can forget is a step
//! that will be forgotten.
//!
//! one-org and one-devops are the same layer, so this goes through a trait the
//! app wires up — the same arrangement `dream_domain_sso::EnterpriseSync` uses.
