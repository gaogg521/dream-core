//! Company (真实企业 / one-enterprise) seat-sync hook for project-group joins.
//!
//! one-org and one-enterprise are same-layer domain crates and must not depend
//! on each other (workspace `AGENTS.md` § Crate Hierarchy). This trait lets a
//! successful project-group join also register the joiner as a company member
//! when the group belongs to one, without one-org depending on one-enterprise;
//! the app layer implements it over `dream_domain_enterprise::EnterpriseService`.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A project group created under a company (`one_tenants.enterprise_id`) hands
//! out its own invite codes, and joining one has never touched
//! `one_enterprise_members` — only SSO login does, via the separate
//! `EnterpriseSync` hook. That left a gap: a company admin can invite an
//! unbounded number of people into "their" project groups (who then use the
//! company's model channels / team resources), and not one of them shows up
//! in the company's "成员" list or counts against its seat limit — the
//! subscription's whole point silently does not apply to this path.
//!
//! When no hook is wired (personal edition, unit tests, or a group with no
//! `enterprise_id`) a project-group join behaves exactly as before — nothing
//! else happens.
