//! Which MCP servers a conversation gets, shared by the aionrs and ACP factories.
//!
//! Both factories used to inline the same rule, and both dropped every built-in
//! server on sight. That was right when built-ins were things a session should
//! only get when explicitly asked for (the PDF exporter, the team knowledge
//! base) — but it left the media generation server unreachable for any agent,
//! because a built-in can only ride in on the session snapshot the desktop
//! renderer writes, and only the new-conversation screen writes one. Every
//! conversation created anywhere else — a digital employee, a scheduled task, a
//! team member, or simply an older conversation — carries `mcp_server_ids: null`
//! and therefore had no way to generate an image or a video at all.
//!
//! So a narrow class of built-ins now rides on its own `enabled` flag instead,
//! which is exactly what the renderer already does for new conversations (see
//! `withBuiltinMediaMcp` in 1oneUI). Putting the rule here means one answer for
//! every conversation, however it was created.
