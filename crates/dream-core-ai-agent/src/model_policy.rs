//! Company model policy as seen by the agent factory.
//!
//! The billing plane owns the model allowlist, but `one-billing` and this crate
//! sit at the same layer, so the factory cannot call it directly. Same shape as
//! [`dream_core_auth::IpAllowlistGate`] / `dream_core_conversation::SendGate`: the trait
//! lives here, `aionui-app` implements it over `BillingService`.
//!
//! Why the factory needs it at all: the allowlist used to be enforced only on
//! the *session* model — at send (`SendGate::check_send`) and at model switch
//! (`SendGate::check_model`). The vision delegate that `ReadImage` calls is a
//! second, independent model choice made here, so an admin who removed a model
//! from the allowlist could still have it invoked as a delegate.
