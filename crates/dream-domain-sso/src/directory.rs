//! Bulk directory pull (T6) — the company's org chart, not one login's profile.
//!
//! # Why this exists separately from the login path
//!
//! Until now the only org data this product had arrived one person at a time,
//! at the moment they logged in (`service.rs`'s profile refresh). That is
//! enough to label a member, and useless for the two things a 200-person
//! customer actually asks for: *give me the org chart without anyone typing it
//! in*, and *tell me when someone leaves*. Neither can be answered by data that
//! only appears when the subject shows up — a person who has left is precisely
//! the person who stops logging in.
//!
//! So this pulls the whole directory on a schedule and hands it over as a
//! snapshot.
//!
//! # The one invariant that matters
//!
//! [`DirectorySnapshot::complete`] is the difference between a useful feature
//! and a dangerous one. Downstream, "absent from the directory" is what marks
//! somebody as having left, and acting on that removes their access, rotates
//! their tokens and reassigns their resources. A half-finished pull — one page
//! that 500'd, a token that expired mid-walk — looks exactly like a company
//! where everyone quit at once.
//!
//! Every failure path here therefore returns an *incomplete* snapshot rather
//! than a shorter list, and the storage side refuses to draw departure
//! conclusions from one. This mirrors the `authoritative` flag that the team
//! skill / MCP / model-channel syncs already use for the same reason.
//!
//! # Provider coverage
//!
//! Feishu only, deliberately. It is the one provider with an app-level token,
//! Contact API plumbing, and a `base_url` override that lets a test point it at
//! a mock server. DingTalk and WeCom have absolute hardcoded URLs and no
//! override, so nothing about them could be verified — [`DirectorySource`] is
//! shaped to take them later without changing callers.
