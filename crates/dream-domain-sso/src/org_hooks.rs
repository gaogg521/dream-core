//! Project-group (one-org) auto-join hook for SSO login (P2-4 onboarding).
//!
//! Kept as a trait so one-sso does not take a hard dependency on one-org
//! (same-layer domain crates interact through traits only). The app layer
//! implements it over `dream_domain_org::OrgService::auto_join_by_email`. When no hook
//! is wired (personal edition, unit tests, or a login with no usable email)
//! SSO login behaves exactly as before — authenticate only.
//!
//! Deliberately SEPARATE from `EnterpriseSync`: this joins a `one_tenants`
//! project group by email-domain policy, never the SSO "real company".
