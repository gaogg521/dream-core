//! Enterprise-org sync hook for SSO login.
//!
//! Kept as a trait so one-sso does not take a hard dependency on one-enterprise
//! (same-layer domain crates interact through traits only). The app layer
//! implements it over `dream_domain_enterprise::EnterpriseService::sync_member`. When no
//! sync is wired (personal edition, unit tests) SSO login behaves exactly as
//! before — authenticate only, nothing else.
//!
//! This is the "enterprise org" dimension, deliberately SEPARATE from project
//! groups: it reflects the user's real SSO company + department and never
//! touches `one_tenants` / project-group membership.
