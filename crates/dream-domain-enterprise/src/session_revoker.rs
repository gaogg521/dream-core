//! Ending a company membership has to end the access that came with it.
//!
//! Company membership is the seat AND the identity tier (企业 ⊃ 项目组), so
//! deleting the row without touching the session leaves a removed person fully
//! logged in — holding a valid JWT and a company model channel token — until
//! the token happens to expire. That is precisely the state the T6 departure
//! flow exists to end: the console would report "已移出企业" while the leaver
//! keeps working.
//!
//! The rotation itself lives in one-org (`OrgService`, which owns the user's
//! JWT secret and, through its own `CredentialRevoker`, the channel tokens).
//! one-org and one-enterprise are the same layer, so this goes through a trait
//! the app wires up — the same arrangement as `dream_domain_sso::EnterpriseSync` and
//! `dream_domain_org::CredentialRevoker`.
