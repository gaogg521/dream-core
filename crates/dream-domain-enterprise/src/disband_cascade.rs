//! Deleting a company must also delete what it owns elsewhere.
//!
//! A company (`one_enterprises`) sits at the top of "企业 ⊃ 项目组 ⊃ 个人" —
//! every project group under it (`one_tenants.enterprise_id`, owned by
//! one-org) and every billing/usage record attributed to it
//! (`one_usage_events` and friends, owned by one-billing) only makes sense as
//! long as the company exists. one-enterprise/one-org/one-billing are the
//! same layer, so this goes through a trait the app wires up — the same
//! arrangement as `SessionRevoker` and `dream_domain_org::CredentialRevoker`.
