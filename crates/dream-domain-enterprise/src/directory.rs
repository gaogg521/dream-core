//! The company directory mirror (T6) and the departure signal derived from it.
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! It is not membership and it is not seats. `one_enterprise_members` is the
//! seat table — billing counts rows in it — and it only ever holds people who
//! have signed in. This mirror holds what the IdP says exists, most of whom
//! will never log in. Keeping them apart is the difference between "sync the
//! directory" and "bill for the whole company the first time sync runs".
//!
//! # The rule that makes this safe
//!
//! Absence from the directory is how somebody gets flagged as having left, and
//! acting on that flag removes their access, rotates their tokens and hands
//! their resources to someone else. So absence has to mean *absence*, not
//! *we didn't manage to fetch them*.
//!
//! [`DirectorySyncInput::complete`] carries that distinction from the fetch
//! side, and [`EnterpriseService::apply_directory_snapshot`] refuses to draw any
//! departure conclusion when it is `false`. An incomplete pull still refreshes
//! what it did see — that data is real — but it cannot mark anyone missing and
//! it cannot clear anyone's existing missing flag either.
//!
//! Same shape as the `authoritative` flag on the team skill / MCP /
//! model-channel syncs, for the same reason.
